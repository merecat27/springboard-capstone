# Springboard Capstone

This repo contains all the deliverables for my capstone project for the cybersecurity career track at Springboard. The project was a structured walkthrough of a penetration test carried out on a fictional gas company.

## Phase 1: OSINT Reconnaissance
A discussion of what open-source intelligence can be gathered without interacting directly with the company in a detectable way, as well as suggestions for tools that can help in doing so.

## Phase 2: Active Reconnaissance
A list of tools with usage examples that can be used in active reconnaissance, such as nmap, nslookup, and certain metasploit modules.

## Phase 3: Identify Vulnerabilities
A list of vulnerability scanning tools with usage examples and pros/cons of each.

## Phase 4: Threat Assessment
A risk analysis of each of 9 potential threats facing the network in question, including remediation and CVSS scores.

## Detailed Technical Report & Executive Summary
Exactly what it says on the tin. Executive summary is a brief overview of the severity of the results, and the technical report has specific discussions of individual results and remediation actions.
